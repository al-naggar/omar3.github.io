<P>iPhone 7 price

With all these advanced features, I can anticipate the price of iPhone 7 may fall between the price range of 800-900 USD depending upon different locations and GB memory. The Phone could be available in contract with mobile carriers but at this point of time it is pretty hard to predict which carrier will have the privilege. With contract, the consumer will have to spend a couple of hundred dollar initially and rest can be paid in due course as contract lasts. Below are the tentative price of iPhone 7 in different countries.</P>
